@webpage{tavis13,
	Abstract = {Two years ago I developed a case of Emacs Pinkie (RSI) so severe my hands went numb and I could no longer type or work. Desperate, I tried voice recognition. At first programming with it was painfully slow but, as I couldn't type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking and duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that enabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had by hand.

In a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python, plus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without touching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain prose. It's now a highly effective tool that could benefit all programmers.},

	Abstract = {<p>TouchDevelop represents a radically new programming environment that enables
	users to develop mobile applications directly on mobile devices. TouchDevelop has
	successfully drawn a huge number of end users, who have published thousands of
	TouchDevelop scripts online. To enhance end-user programming on mobile devices,
	we conduct the first comprehensive field study of 17322 TouchDevelop scripts and
	4275 users. Our study consists of an overall study on the characteristics of
	scripts (e.g., structural features, code reuse) and users (e.g., expertise), and
	a longitudinal study on how they evolve over time. Our study results show
	important characteristics of scripts such as dense external method calls, high
	code reuse ratio, and also reveal interesting evolution patterns of users. The
	findings and implications in our study provide valuable guidelines for improving
	tool support or services for end users and increasing the popularity of end-user
	programming on mobile devices.</p>},
