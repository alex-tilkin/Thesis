\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
In the introduction, I expressed the hope that the work in this thesis could be a "first step" towards . In this final chapter, I will conclude by describing the progress made towards this goal in terms of my development of a variational inference framework and its application to problems in a range of domains. I will also suggest some future research directions that could provide the next steps along the path to a practical and widely applicable inference system.

Here you give a summary of your your work and your results. This is like a management summary and should be written in a clear and easy language, without many difficult terms and without abbreviations. Everything you present here must be treated in more detail in the main report. You should not give any references to the report in the summary -- just explain what you have done and what you have found out. The Summary and Conclusions should be no more than two pages.

You may assume that you have got three minutes to present to the Rector of NTNU  what you have done and what you have found out as part of your thesis. (He is an intelligent person, but does not know much about your field of expertise.)
