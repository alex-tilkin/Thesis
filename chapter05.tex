\chapter{Configuration of Representation} \label{chapter:Configuration of Representation}
\section{Introduction}
One goal of this project is to allow the programmer to configure the representation of the code on various devices. PCs are a much more convenient environment for programming than laptops and particularly more convenient than tablets and mobile devices. We would like to allow this ability because every programmer prefers to see the code in different representation. As discussed in \chapref{chapter: Compact Representation} we suggest different styles of compact representation to program idioms. We assume that it would be very convenient for the programmer if s/he could configure different representations for different environments.

This chapter discusses how programming-idioms representation may be configured. This is a basic concept that can guide those who will proceed with this research and will decide to focus on the configuration of the representation of the code. We believe the same configuration techniques may be used for different language features. For example, \textit{Access Levels} may be presented as an icon, text, stylized text e.g., \textit{private}, and may be omitted. Operators may be presented as an icon, text, or stylized text e.g., \textbf{\textit{+}}. It is clear that both operators and accessibilities may be presented by text, stylized text, or as an icon. This conclusion may help those who will design the configuration of the compact representation of operators and the accessibilities (for example: private, public).

The motivation is that developers of a configuration system for a programming feature will be aware of the same configuration techniques may be used for different language features. It will optimize the configuration system and will create a more intuitive experience for the user.

It is important to note that this is a generic idea that can be expanded. Everyone may add language features, a configuration feature or add configuration features to language features.

In what follows, we use the following terms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Configuration Feature - a feature that helps the user to set a configuration for a programming feature, for example, represent a \textit{Access Level} with an icon.
	\item Language Feature - a feature in a programming language, for example, loops.
\end{itemize}
\section{Configuration scope}
\subsection{Configuration Main Settings}
We assume that there are three main modes of configuration of representation: desktop (PCs and laptops) which provides the most detailed environment that the user needs, since it has a big screen; tablet - a smaller environment than the previous one, but the screen is big enough to show details yet fewer; and mobile phones, which is the smallest environment for developing, thus it provides the most compact representation. 

All those configurations come with default settings that meet the requirements of the environment. The user may customize the representations so they will fit his or her needs.
\subsection{Features and Configurations}
In order to understand how each programming feature may be represented, \autoref{chapter: Supported Features} and \autoref{chapter: Compact Representation} describe the information that was reviewed. This information helped us to divide programming features into groups, e.g., operators. After we have grouped the programming features, we created groups of configuration features. Each configuration feature represents a technique of how a programming feature may be represented.
\autoref{tab14} presents the configuration features that we have grouped and \autoref{tab15} presents all language features and the configuration features that may be used to present them. In order to understand how every programming feature may be represented one needs to use tables \ref{tab14} and \ref{tab15}. For example, let us take the first row in \autoref{tab15}. The language feature is Operators, it represents Java operators. The referenced configuration features IDs are: STYLE, ICON, and TEXT, which means it may be represented in three ways.
